# 🌱 Optimal Fertiliser Prediction using XGBoost Classifier

### Demo link: https://optimal-fertilizer-prediction-model.streamlit.app

## 📌 Overview
This project predicts the most suitable fertilizer for a given crop based on environmental and soil parameters using the **XGBoost Classifier**.  
By leveraging factors like **temperature, humidity, moisture, soil type, crop type, and nutrient levels**, the model achieves **95% accuracy** on training data and **100% accuracy** on testing data.
